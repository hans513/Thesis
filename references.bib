abstract = {Based on a recent method of Pople et al for the solution of large systems of linear equations, a procedure is given for accelerating the convergence of slowly converging quasi-Newton— Raphson type algorithms. This procedure is particularly advantageous if the number of parameters is so large that the calculation and storage of the hessian is no longer practical. Application to the SCF problem is treated in detail.},
