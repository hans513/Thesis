\section{INTRODUCTION}
% Hatree-Fock intro
In the fields of computational chemistry and physics, Hartree-Fock is a method used to approximate the electronic distribution of a molecule and the energy of the system. Hartree-Fock is an iterative process which can be quite tedious and time-consuming for large molecules especially if we want to get an accurate description of the orbitals. Speeding up the Hatree-Fock would thus enable us to deal with larger molecules, which can in turn be utilized to study biochemical reaction with very large systems. In essence, speeding up the Hatree-Fock algorithm will save computational cost to solve quantum chemical problems. 



% Parameters
Matteus et al, \cite{Matteus}, proposed a way to embed the parameters.....


The parameters give us the flexibility to control the behaviour of the Hatree-Fock method. This flexibility allows us to let each of the Hatree-Fock iteration makes more progress. In particular, we would like to make single iteration of Hatree-Fock with parameters achieve as much progress as two or even more iterations of the original Hatree-Fock.


% How to do that? (Imitation learning)
This idea can be realized through imitation learning, an algorithm designated to learn expert demonstrations so as to become capable of performing particular tasks. By imitation learning, we can make Hatree-Fock with parameters learn from the original Hatree-Fock, which finally enables it to gain two iterations or more progress in one single iteration.


% Problem encountered   %%%%%
However, imitation learning may yield poor performance in theory and practice since the learner's prediction and action affect future input observations and states during the execution of the learned policy. It obviously violates the common i.i.d. assumption made in most statistical learning approaches. \cite{Ross}.

% The recipe (DAgger)
Fortunately, Ross et al,\cite{DAgger} proposed that the dataset aggregation algorithm (DAgger), which learns a stationary deterministic policy guaranteed to perform well under its induced distribution of states, is a remedy to the poor performance in imitation learning.


In this paper, 
we conduct an interdisciplinary research to introduce the innovative technique - imitation learning to speed up the Hartree-Fock process with dataset aggregation algorithm (DAgger) \cite{DAgger}, which was proven to have stable performance and fast learning rate. \cite{DAggerCompare}

\section{BACKGROUND}
\subsection{Hatree-Fock}
if you want to use more Gaussian functions to get a more accurate description of the orbitals. 

Hartree-Fock is a method used to get the density matrix for a given molecule. The density matrix describes the molecule and the probability distribution of the location of the electrons.

 Hartree-Fock is an approximation for solving the Schrödinger equation where it assumes that the wave function can be approximated by a single Slater determinant. The electrons or orbitals are described with a combination of Gaussian functions.

\subsection{DAgger algorithm}
DAgger algorithm learns expert demonstration and make correction iteratively. In each iteration, it was trained under the states that may be induced by both the expert and itself / the learner. 


by iteratively
training the policy in states induced by all previously learned policies.


For example, during training one
can use a “mixture oracle” that at times takes an action given by the previous learned policy [11].
Alternatively, at each iteration one can learn a policy from trajectories generated by all previous policies [3].


%The present work therefore intends to treat the Hartree-Fock process as an expert demonstration, and we apply DAgger algorithm to imitate the process for learning a fast-forward version of Hartree-Fock.

\section{LEARNING EMBEDDED PARAMETERS}
We can treat the original Hatree-Fock iteration as the expert demonstration. However, instead of learning a duplicate Hatree-Fock process, I would like to learn a "Fast forward" version of Hatree-Fock. For example, under a certain case the original Hatree-Fock may need 30 iterations to converge, we hope we can learn a Hatree-Fock with parameters that can converge in 15 iterations. 

\section{EXPERIMENTS}

\section{GENERAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS}



Both submitted and camera-ready versions of the paper are 8 pages,
plus any additional pages needed for references.

Papers are in 2 columns with the overall line width of 6.75~inches (41~picas). Each column is 3.25~inches wide (19.5~picas).  The space
between the columns is .25~inches wide (1.5~picas).  The left margin is 1~inch (6~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of
11~points. Times Roman is the preferred typeface throughout.

Paper title is 16~point, caps/lc, bold, centered between 2~horizontal rules.  Top rule is 4~points thick and bottom rule is 1~point thick.
Allow 1/4~inch space above and below title to rules.

Author descriptions are center-justified, initial caps.  The lead
author is to be listed first (left-most), and the Co-authors are set
to follow.  If up to three authors, use a single row of author
descriptions, each one center-justified, and all set side by side;
with more authors or unusually long names or institutions, use more
rows.  (But, do not include author names in the initial double-blind
submission!  Instead leave a row of ``Anonymous Author'' descriptions
as above.)


One-half line space between paragraphs, with no indent.

\section{FIRST LEVEL HEADINGS}

First level headings are all caps, flush left, bold, and in point size
12. One line space before the first level heading and 1/2~line space
after the first level heading.

\subsection{Second Level Heading}

Second level headings are initial caps, flush left, bold, and in point
size 10. One line space before the second level heading and 1/2~line
space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}

Third level headings are flush left, initial caps, bold, and in point
size 10. One line space before the third level heading and 1/2~line
space after the third level heading.

\paragraph{Fourth Level Heading}

Fourth level headings must be flush left, initial caps, bold, and
Roman type.  One line space before the fourth level heading, and
place the section text immediately after the heading with, no line
break, but an 11 point horizontal space.

\subsection{CITATIONS, FIGURES, REFERENCES}


\subsubsection{Citations in Text}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
year, e.g., (Cheesman, 1985). References should follow any style that
you are used to using, as long as their style is consistent throughout
the paper.  Be sure that the sentence reads correctly if the citation
is deleted: e.g., instead of ``As described by (Cheesman, 1985), we
first frobulate the widgets,'' write ``As described by Cheesman
(1985), we first frobulate the widgets.''  Be sure to avoid
accidentally disclosing author identities through citations.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Use 8 point type for footnotes. Place the
footnotes at the bottom of the column in which their markers appear,
continuing to the next column if required. Precede the footnote
section of a column with a 0.5 point horizontal rule 1~inch (6~picas)
long.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

\subsubsection{Figures}

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible.  All lines
should be very dark for purposes of reproduction, and art work should
not be hand-drawn.  Figures may appear at the top of a column, at the
top of a page spanning multiple columns, inline within a column, or
with text wrapped around them, but the figure number and caption
always appear immediately below the figure.  Leave 2 line spaces
between the figure and the caption. The figure caption is initial caps
and each figure should be numbered consecutively.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page rather than
splitting the figure and figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{.3in}
\centerline{\fbox{This figure intentionally left non-blank}}
\vspace{.3in}
\caption{Sample Figure Caption}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. Do not use hand-drawn tables. Table number and title always appear above the table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

One line space before the table title, one line space after the table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be
initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sample Table Title} \label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf PART}  &{\bf DESCRIPTION} \\

\section{INSTRUCTIONS FOR CAMERA-READY PAPERS}

For the camera-ready paper, if you are using \LaTeX, please make sure
that you follow these instructions.  (If you are not using \LaTeX,
please make sure to achieve the same effect using your chosen
typesetting package.)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install the package \texttt{fancyhdr.sty}. The
    \texttt{aistats2014.sty} file will make use of it.
    \item Begin your document with
    \begin{flushleft}
    \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[twoside]\{article\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[accepted]\{aistats2014\}}
    \end{flushleft}
    The \texttt{twoside} option for the class article allows the
    package \texttt{fancyhdr.sty} to include headings for even and odd
    numbered pages. The option \texttt{accepted} for the package
    \texttt{aistats2014.sty} will write a copyright notice at the end of
    the first column of the first page. This option will also print
    headings for the paper.  For the \emph{even} pages, the title of
    the paper will be used as heading and for \emph{odd} pages the
    author names will be used as heading.  If the title of the paper
    is too long or the number of authors is too large, the style will
    print a warning message as heading. If this happens additional
    commands can be used to place as headings shorter versions of the
    title and the author names. This is explained in the next point.
    \item  If you get warning messages as described above, then
    immediately after $\texttt{\textbackslash
    begin\{document\}}$, write
    \begin{flushleft}
    \texttt{\textbackslash runningtitle\{Provide here an alternative shorter version of the title of your
    paper\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash runningauthor\{Provide here the surnames of the authors of your paper, all separated by
    commas\}}
    \end{flushleft}
    The text that appears as argument in \texttt{\textbackslash
      runningtitle} will be printed as a heading in the \emph{even}
    pages. The text that appears as argument in \texttt{\textbackslash
      runningauthor} will be printed as a heading in the \emph{odd}
    pages.  If even the author surnames do not fit, it is acceptable
    to give a subset of author names followed by ``et al.''

    \item Use the file sample\_paper.tex as an example.

    \item Both submitted and camera-ready versions of the paper are 8
      pages, plus any additional pages needed for references.

    \item If you need to include additional appendices,
      you can include them in the supplementary
      material file.

    \item Please, don't change the layout given by the above
      instructions and by the style file.

\end{enumerate}
